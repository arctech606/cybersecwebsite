<h1>STUDENT’S CORNER</h1>
 
Texas A&M has a long history of providing information assurance and cybersecurity educational opportunities for its students. Dating back to the mid-1990s, A&M faculty developed the first academic courses that employed active attack-defense laboratory exercises that emphasized the importance of hands-on activities to facilitate and accelerate student learning. This then novel approach has now been widely adopted throughout educational and training settings where cybersecurity topics are taught. A&M students have benefited directly from these educational innovations and, through their studies and associated hands-on experiences, they have consistently been able to rapidly acquire important cybersecurity knowledge and skills.

Texas A&M University offers students interested in cybersecurity a variety of ways to learn and be involved. The University offers several cybersecurity courses of study for both undergraduate and graduate students, ranging from a minor to a graduate designation. Additionally by participating in weekly Cybersecurity Club meetings, students can hear from guest speakers, receive hands-on cybersecurity training, and participate in national hack-a-thon events.
